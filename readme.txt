This plugin displays a Google static map based on your latest update to instamapper.com

This plugin uses the instamapper.com API and Google API to get the latest geo location updates from your mobile devices (iPhone included). A map is then displayed as a widget.

This plugin allows you to enable / disable the exact location pin, change the zoom level, map size, pin colour and pin letter.
