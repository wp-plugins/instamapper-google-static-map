This plugin displays a Google static map based on your latest update to instamapper.com

== Description ==

This plugin uses the instamapper.com API and Google API to get the latest geo location updates from your mobile devices (iPhone included). A map is then displayed as a widget.

This plugin allows you to enable / disable the exact location pin, change the zoom level, map size, pin colour and pin letter.
